Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
answer:
RISC-V's function call process parameters are transferred by register first, that is,
there are 8 registers in a0~a7. The return value can be placed in the a0 and a1 registers.
The parameter 13 of printf is stored in the a2 register.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
answer:
As can be seen from the code, both of these are handled by inline optimization. 
The f call in main uses the result 12 directly, 
and the function g call in f is directly inlined in f.

At what address is the functionprintflocated?
answer:
0x630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
answer:
The value should be 0x38, which is the return address of the function.

Run the following code.

unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
answer:
The result is: He110 World; do not modify it to 0x726c6400; 57616 does not need to be changed, the compiler will convert it.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen? printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
answer:
The value of register a2 should be printed out, because printf will read the third parameter from register a2 as the value of y.
